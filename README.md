### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laren, a third year Master's student in Computer Science at Texas A&M. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, majoring in Chemistry with the Elements of Computing certificate. I love coffee, trivia, and electronic music. I mostly use Python, but I've used all sorts of languages at one point or another through the random computing courses I've taken. I currently work in Dr. James Caverlee's lab on a variety of data mining and information retrieval research topics.
