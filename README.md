### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Laren, a software engineer at Pacific Northwest National Lab, working in the Research Computing directorate on the AI/ML Solutions team. I graduated from Texas A&M in 2024, earning a MS in computer science under Dr. James Caverlee. My thesis was entitled "Compressing Ethical AI: Quantization Effects Of Large Language Models For Ethical Question Answering." Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, majoring in Chemistry with the Elements of Computing certificate.
